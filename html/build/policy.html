        <h2>Our Commitment to Privacy</h2>
        <p>Our Privacy Policy was developed as an extension of our commitment to combine quality products and services with integrity in dealing with our users. This policy is designed to assist you in understanding how we collect, use, and safeguard the personal information you provide to us and to assist you in making informed decisions when using our site and products and services. As we continue to develop our web site and take advantage of advances in technology, our privacy policy may change. Please refer to this page frequently for the most up-to-date information.</p>

For non-registered users, we request account information (email address and password), and billing and shipping information for orders placed during each visit. As a registered customer, you only have to enter your billing and shipping addresses and account information once; they will be securely stored in our database for your future use. Use your username and password to access your account online at any time when adding, deleting, or modifying information. If you are using a computer at a public place, we encourage you to log out at the end of your session. Your information is securely stored with us and will not be accessible to anyone else from that computer.</p>

This may include your name, shipping address, billing address, telephone number, credit/debit card number with expiration date, and email address. If you enter certain of our contests or giveaways, we may collect additional information. Under no circumstances do we ever share, sell, or rent your personal information to outside parties. In addition to the below uses, the customer contact information you provide may be used to contact you concerning the status of an order, answer your questions and, unless you choose to opt-out, to send you communications about upcoming sales, discounts, contests, promotions and product information.</p>

        <h2>Billing Information</h2>

        <p></p>After placing an order with the Site, you will receive an email confirmation that we have received your order. You will receive this email only if you have provided us with your correct email address. We may also need to contact you via email if we have questions regarding your order. Your email information may also be used for future ShellHolster Email Newsletters, which will include unsubscribing instructions. We would like to reiterate that under no circumstances do we ever share, sell, or rent your personal information with outside parties.</p>
